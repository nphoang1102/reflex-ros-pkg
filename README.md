This package was directly forked off this repository by RightHand Robotics https://github.com/RightHandRobotics/reflex-ros-pkg. Please refer to the RightHand Robotics' repository for the latest package update, instruction and configuration.

This package was developed to run with this dynamixel_motor package https://github.com/nphoang1102/dynamixel_motor for WPI's MQP project. Thus, please feel free to contact me if there are any issues with the package or if you have any questions, as I cannot be absolutely sure this package will work for you.

Using this package
------

The dynamixel_motor package mentioned above must be put under the same catkin workspace of ROS for this package to work. Please launch using the reflex_sf.launch file.

The Rqt GUI interface with the hand is under the Rqt folders with the README.md file on how to run the interface can be located under those respective folders.

The glove controller interface is under the arduino_glove folder, and again please see the README.md file in that folder on how to setup and run the controller.
